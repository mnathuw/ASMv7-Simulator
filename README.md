# ARMv7-Simulator

A Python-based simulator and disassembler for the ARMv7 32-bit ISA and 16-bit Thumb instruction set. This project was developed as part of CP216 Intro to Microprocessors.

## Features

1. ARMv7 and Thumb instruction support
2. Instruction decoding and encoding
3. Pipelined CPU modeling
4. Memory model implementation
5. Register state management
6. Simulation output displaying register and memory changes
7. Extensible lookup tables for opcodes and registers
8. Test cases for verification
9. Optional GUI interface for visualization

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository (Python 3.8+ recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnathuw/ARMv7-Simulator.git
cd ARMv7-Simulator
```
2. Run test program
```bash
python assembly.py Demo/find_max_thumb.txt
```
3. [Optional] Launch the GUI (if this task has done)
```bash
python ui.py
```
